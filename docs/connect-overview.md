# connect (built-in task)
Start a static web server.

## About

This task starts a static web server on a specified port, at a specified path, which runs as long as grunt is running. Once grunt's tasks have completed, the web server stops.

## A Very Important Note
Your Gruntfile **must** contain this code, once and **only** once. If it doesn't, grunt won't work. For the sake of brevity, this "wrapper" code has been omitted from all examples on this page, but it needs to be there.

```javascript
module.exports = function(grunt) {
  // Your grunt code goes in here.
};
```

## Project configuration

This example shows a brief overview of the [options](connect-options.md) properties used by the `connect` task. For a more in-depth explanation, see the usage examples.

```javascript
// Project configuration.
grunt.initConfig({

  connect: {
    // Configuration options.
    options: {
      
    }
  }
});
```
